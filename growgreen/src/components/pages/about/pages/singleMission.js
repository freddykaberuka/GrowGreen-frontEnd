                <p>When farmers improve their harvests, they pull themselves out of poverty. They also start producing surplus food for their neighbors. When farmers prosper, they eradicate poverty and hunger in their communities.</p>
                <p>Grow Green Rwanda is growing quickly and we are proud to soon represent Africaâ€™s largest network of smallholder farmers. Today, we are privileged to serve over 1 million farm families - with more than 5 million people living in those families.  And the farmers we serve will produce enough surplus food to feed another 5 million of their neighbors.</p>
                <p>This is only the tip of the iceberg. When millions of farmers speak with one voice, we can more effectively pursue collaboration together with government and the private sector to broaden our reach.</p>
